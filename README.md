# Mechatronics Systems Design 

## Course Description

Welcome to the crossroads of innovation where mechanical systems shake hands with the digital world - Mechatronics Systems Design! Imagine a world where your creations can sense, act, and think. In this course, you will breathe life into metal and wires, transforming static pieces of technology into dynamic systems that respond to the environment with precision and intelligence. From the rumbling engines of industry to the silent precision of digital devices, mechatronics is the invisible thread that weaves through the fabric of modern technology. You will start by building a solid foundation, understanding the interplay between resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Then, like an architect of the algorithmic age, you will harness the power of the Arduino to bridge the gap between binary and mechanical. Through hands-on experiments and collaborative projects, you will design, prototype, and test systems that could change the way we live. This is not just learning; it's a transformation into the innovators and problem solvers that the future demands. Buckle up for an adventure in Mechatronics Systems Design.
